#Emil Oberg / dotfiles

### Installation 

Create symlinks for all dotfiles:

```
./install-dotfiles.sh
```

Install all `brew`, `brew cask` and `Apple Store` apps. This _will_ take a long time as there's a lot of apps to install. Open `Brewfile` in your favourite text editor to see what's going to be installed.

```
./install-brew.sh
```


### Update

Run

```
./save-brew.sh
```

to save all `brew`, `brew cask` and `Apple Store` apps into `Brewfile`.

Commit and push!
